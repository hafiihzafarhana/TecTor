# TecTor Extension
### TecTor is a lightweight Chrome extension that automatically detects which web technologies are being used on any website you visit.

It identifies popular frontend and hosting tools such as:

🌐 Netlify Hosting

Built with modular JavaScript and bundled using esbuild for optimal performance and clean code structure.
- Detects technologies instantly as you browse websites

- Minimal UI in popup showing detected stack

- Clean and modular codebase (split into reusable detectors)

- Uses Chrome Manifest V3 and service_worker background scripts

- Fully open-source and easy to customize

## 🔧 How It Works
